I have made a Plenty of Features in Jarvis! :-

Say 'Jarvis' After saying a command to activiate jarvis again, if its app is closed then hes dead

Say 'Exit' to close jarvis

1- say 'Wikipedia' at the last of the sentence that you are saying and The jarvis will search that in wikipedia! If You See a Error and Jarvis is Closed tha means The thing you searched was wrong!
